// Use this file to write and compile SCSS. Note that the compiled CSS file
// (assets/css/subtheme.css) is already included in the sub-theme.
//
// To compile the SCSS, first, run "npm install" or "yarn install"
// from the sub-theme directory to install the required packages,
// then run the "gulp" command to watch for changes in SCSS files and compile the style.
//
// The simplest way to override the theme style is by overriding the SCSS variables.
// To do that, uncomment the line above:
//
// @import "themag/scss/themag";
//
// Then, use _variables.scss to override the default variables from TheMAG.
//
// If you'd like to have more control over TheMAG style components,
// you can import all the components separately instead of importing the entire style at once.
//

@import "variables";
// @import "themag/scss/themag";
